	<h2>About Dogenerator</h2>
	<p>
		Dogenerator turns text into doge. Made at Thanksgiving party 2013 by Jenny (doge expert), Steven (top coder), and Victor (moral support).
	</p>
	<p>
		Inspired by "Hey we should create a doge generator" and "We have three CS majors and two laptops between us, I bet it would take an hour tops."
	</p>
	<p>
		Dedicated to Stephen, Jenny's favorite doge.
	</p>
	<h2>Coming Soon</h2>
	<p>
		Actually generating doge images! Colors and comic sans!
	</p>
